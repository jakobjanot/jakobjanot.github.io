    summary: |
      I am good listener, and I like to learn from colleagues and relevant software communities. 
      I am creative and an experienced software developer, hence I can rapidly turn a good idea 
      into a prototype. I have a good understanding of data architecture and knowledge management 
      and a lot of experience with transformation and analysis of structured as well as unstructured data, 
      i.e., text, XML, images, biological data etc. I also have over seven years of experience with agile 
      software development, including test driven development, code reviews, continuous integration, 
      app containerization, cloud services etc.
